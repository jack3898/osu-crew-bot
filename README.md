_Thanks DALL-E for the generic bot picture!_

This is an in-house Discord bot for the Osu! Crew community server. It just fills the gaps that third-party bots cannot fill, and as such this bot isn't meant to replace those - only compliment.

## Features

- Assign roles based on one's Osu! rank

That's it so far. ðŸ¤£

## Setup

Please see SETUP.md for further instructions on how to set this bot up.
